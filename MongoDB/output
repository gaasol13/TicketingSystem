=== MongoDB Simulation Results ===
Event: Jazz Nights

POSITIVE SCENARIO Results:
- Dynamic fields processed: 3

NEGATIVE SCENARIO Results:
- Total booking attempts: 5
- Successful bookings: 0
- Failed bookings: 5
- Concurrency conflicts: 0
- Remaining tickets: 0

Key Findings:
1. Document Flexibility: MongoDB handled dynamic fields efficiently
2. Concurrency Challenges: 0.0% conflict rate
